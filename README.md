# OpenMemes
A place for open source memes!

## Contributing
Feel free to make a PR adding your memes, put `*.xcf` files in the root directory, and source images in the `src/` dir. Finished products should not be in this repo.

## License
The `*.xcf` files are licensed under the BSD-3-clause license. This licensing only includes those files, NOT any files found in the `src/` directory, as it's authors are (for the most part) unknown.
